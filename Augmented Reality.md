# Augmented Reality

* Tools. Vuforia Engine // ArUco // Snapdragon (Qualcomm)
* How it works. Augmented reality needs info and a marker / model (target). Once the app identifies the mark, it shows the info.
* Ideas:
    1. Shareable info + markers [maybe a scanner that helps you create markers]
    2. Automatic translation 
* How to begin: [Vuforia Docs](https://developer.vuforia.com/) 
    1. How to create a model: [QClone](https://www.qclone.pro/)
    2. Simple projects with text display: [Wikitude](https://studio.wikitude.com/projects/)
* Structure: Front: Get info from mobile. Back: keeps the infoyou want to show.
